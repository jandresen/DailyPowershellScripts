# DailyPowershellScripts
Just the powershell scripts that I use. All private information has been obfuscated with fake names so you will have to change the variables. I try to put the variables in the top of the board and dynamically grab things when I can. 

Not sure how you got here...

Welcome! 

This is my collection of random scripts that I use daily. 
All scripts has their personal details removed and replaced with either variables that you can set at the top of each script or are dynamicly grabbed.

I try to stay professional with my script comments, but sometimes im just in a good mood and leave something terribly written. 
If you get offended by my terrible scripting, please do let me know of a better way, as I am trying to learn constantly. 

Oh and I am danish so there might be a spelling mistake somewhere or something that doesnt make sense. If you see it, please do let me know so I can fix it as well. 

I am also new to github so hopefully I wont mess up my very first repository. 

Let me know if you like it or have comments - @jcandresen
